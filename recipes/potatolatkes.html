<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Latkes (a.k.a. potato pancakes) are a crowd-pleasing addition to any table — and this family 
    recipe will impress even the pickiest eaters. The secret ingredient? Saltine crackers! 
    The pantry staple replaces all-purpose flour, binds the latkes together, and contributes 
    to the irresistible texture. 
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
    <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat</li>
    <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to
        remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the 
        oil with the back of your spoon so they are an even thickness.</li>
    <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. 
        Drain latkes on a paper towel-line plate.</li>
    
</ol>
